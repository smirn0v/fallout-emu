<title>What is pev?</title>

<para>
Since version 0.50, pev is a multiplatform toolkit to work with PE (Portable
Executable) binaries. Its main goal is to provide feature-rich tool for proper
analyze binaries, specially suspicious ones.</para>

<title>History</title>

<para>
pev has born of a simple need: a program to find the version (File Version) of
a PE32 file and that could be run in Linux. This version number is stored in
Resources (.rsrc) section but at the time we've decided to simply search for
the string in the whole binary, without any optimization.
</para>


<para>
Later on we've decided to parse the PE32 file until reach .rsrc section and
get the File Version field. In order to do that, we realized we must parse the
entire file and we thought if we could print out all the fields and values as well...
</para>

<para>
Until version 0.40, pev was an unique program for parse the PE headers and sections
(now readpe is responsible for this). In version 0.50 we focused on malware analysis
and splitted pev into various programs beyond a library, called libpe. Currently
all pev programs use libpe.
